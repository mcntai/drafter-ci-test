          # Commits spec, you can use these options to customize the parsing of the type, scope and
          # subject. The `headerPattern` should contain a regex where the capturing groups in parentheses
          # correspond to the parts listed in `headerPatternCorrespondence`.

          # this option and therefore this action allows you to opt-in to using the
          # special "[WIP]" prefix to indicate this state. This will avoid the
          # validation of the PR title and the pull request checks remain pending.
          # Note that a second check will be reported if this is enabled.
